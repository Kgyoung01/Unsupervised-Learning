Myopia Clusters

Recommendation: The Elbow Curve helps us determine the preferred number of clusters to use for k-means cluster analysis
- The elbow curve indicates an optimal number of 3 clusters

Based on the findings from the elbow curve/k-means cluster analysis

- Recommend splitting into 3 groups of patients to see the cluster perform best in comparision to 4 & 5
